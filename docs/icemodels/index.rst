=======================

IceModels is a Python package for analyzing and modeling ice spectra in astronomical observations. It provides tools for:

* Loading and manipulating ice optical constants
* Computing absorption spectra for different ice compositions
* Working with various ice databases (OCDB, LIDA, Univap)
* Modeling ice spectra with Gaussian components
* Analyzing spectral data through various filters
